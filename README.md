# UserScripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts that I have written to automate various tasks on websites. These
scripts are intended to be used with the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extension.

## Scripts

### DisableTwitchVisabilityAPI

This script disables the Twitch Visibility API, which is used to determine if a user is currently watching a stream.
This can be useful for streamers who want to appear offline while watching other streams.

---

### DownloadDirectoryListing

Download all files from an index page like Apache directory listing, can be a list of files on the page or can be
recursive to download all files in subdirectories.

---

### LIHKGShowHiddenVotes

Self-explanatory, show hidden votes on LIHKG. Doesn't work all the time because I wrote this so badly, maybe I'll fix it
someday (hopefully).

---

### CopyToFixupX
Modify all copy links on twitter (x.com) to (fixupx.com) to allow preview on discord.

---

### Disable Console Clear
Disable the console clear function, useful for debugging. Call `restoreConsoleClear()` to restore the function.

## Usage

Go to the script's page on GitHub, click the "Raw" button to initiate the installation.
